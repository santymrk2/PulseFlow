## Short description

FreeShow is a free and open-source presentation program that makes it easy to show text on a big screen. It supports stage display, remote control, media, and many other advanced features. It is open-sourced meaning anyone can contribute.

FreeShow exists because the creator found that other similar programs were either expensive or complex to use. He wanted to create a program that is easy to use and affordable for everyone, from small churches to large venues. FreeShow is now used by people all over the world.

## Support Us

The only reason this program is free is because of the generous support from users. If you want to support us to keep this free, please head over to [ChurchApps](https://churchapps.org/partner) or [sponsor us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/ChurchApps/). Thank you so much!

## Help the development

You are welcome to contribute to the code!

PulseFlow runs on macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel) and Windows 10/11 (x64) only.

1. Clone this repo
2. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
3. On Windows, download [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and install "Desktop development with C++", also select the "Windows 10 SDK"
4. In the terminal, run: `bun install`
5. To start the app, run: `bun run dev:tauri` (frontend only: `bun run dev`)

## Packaging, signing and notarization

PulseFlow is built with `bun run build:tauri` (Tauri v2). Bundles are limited to `.app`/`.dmg` on macOS and NSIS on Windows (see `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`).

### macOS

- Privacy permissions live in `src-tauri/Info.plist` (`NSCameraUsageDescription`, `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`, `NSScreenCaptureUsageDescription`) and are merged into the `.app` automatically.
- Hardened-runtime entitlements (JIT, camera, microphone) live in `src-tauri/Entitlements.plist` (`bundle.macOS.entitlements`).
- To code sign and notarize, set these environment variables before `bun run build:tauri`:
  - `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`: `Developer ID Application: <name> (<team id>)`
  - `APPLE_ID` + `APPLE_PASSWORD` (app-specific password) + `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: enable notarization and stapling.
- Without those variables the build is ad-hoc signed (fine for local testing, not for distribution).

### Windows

- To Authenticode-sign the NSIS installer, configure `bundle.windows.signCommand` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` pointing to your signing tool (e.g. `signtool.exe sign /fd SHA256 /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com {exe}`) and provide the certificate through your tool of choice.
- The WebView2 runtime is installed via `downloadBootstrapper` when missing.
